To compile all the files run: make                                                     #
                                                                                       #
To delete .o files and images run: make clean                                          #
                                                                                       #
Information about seq_main execution in file README_seq_main.                          #
                                                                                       #
To run seq_main 10 times and get mean execution time and standard deviation            #
for all the thread values at once,                                                     #
follow these steps: 1)mkdir test in our working directory.                             #
2)Specify the number of clusters in the following format: ./script.sh [NumClusters]    #
3)This script will write all the measurements in the directory named as test. It will  #
also make a file with name "newlog_file" with the mean execution time and standard     #
deviation, following by the number of threads (1,2,4,8,16,32,64) using manipulator.c   #
4)To delete the temporary file that script used, run: rm temp_file                     #
                                                                                       #
                                                                                       #
If you want to run again this script, please delete the previous test file             #
with the command: rm -r test                                                           #
